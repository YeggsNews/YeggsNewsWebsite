        <p style="text-align:center;">"It's <i>launch day</i>! Don't know how frequently we will update this, but we figured that we might as well
            save ourselves some time while we at it, so here's the first chunk of text.<br><br>

            Unfortunately at the time of writing this nothing really happened in Yeggs, so we're going to continue setting
            this up while maybe... something happens?<br>

            If during the day there's nothing to write about we'll probably going to leave this blank or just talk about general
            Yeggs without actually bringing in news... :(<br><br>

            Also yeah, <b>it's just HTML</b>, but unfortunately Yeggs' founds are not big enough; but <i>you</i> can support us by buying our maps
            in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/creator?name=yeggs">Bedrock Marketplace!</a><br>
            Right now our team will probably work on making the text scale well based on your resolution, so for the time being
            if you need to zoom in our out a lot to read this, sorry!"
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;"><i>CURRENT HOT TOPICS (probably will be talked about here at one point):</i><br>
        'Chopper can't cook','Join the Minecraft Live Yeggs tournament!'.
